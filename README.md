# Alien Dark - An Alien-Friendly VSCode Dark Theme

Welcome to Alien Dark ðŸ‘½ - the VSCode dark theme that's out of this world! ðŸš€

Alien Dark is a dark theme for Visual Studio Code that's designed to be alien-friendly, with a sleek and modern look that's easy on the eyes. This theme is perfect for developers who want a unique, visually-stunning coding experience.


NOTE: This theme is a work in progress, and I'm always looking for ways to improve it. Until I publish it, you can install it by downloading the repository, opening it in VSCode, and pressing F5 to run the theme extension.

I hope you like it!
