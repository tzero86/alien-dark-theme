Welcome to Alien Dark ðŸ‘½ - the VSCode dark theme that's out of this world! ðŸš€

Alien Dark is a dark theme for Visual Studio Code that's designed to be alien-friendly, with a sleek and modern look that's easy on the eyes. This theme is perfect for developers who want a unique, visually-stunning coding experience.

The initial version has been released, and I'm currently working on adding more features and improving the theme.


NOTE: This theme is a work in progress, and I'm always looking for ways to improve it.



I hope you like it!
